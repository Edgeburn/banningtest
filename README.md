# Ban Screen Test

Install Fabric to 1.19.1-rc1, and install this mod to the mods folder. **While this should not effect your account, for safety reasons, you should run this mod only with your Internet connection disabled.**

Please note that this mod will not be updated (by me, you are welcome to submit PRs with updates) beyond the final release of Minecraft 1.19.1 unless any significant changes are made to the client-side banning system.
